					Runningbyrd Tea is not just about flavor or refreshment. Runningbyrd Tea is about the experience of drinking a cool glass of tea on a hot day. It is about the memories we associate with iced tea. Runningbyrd Tea is about sitting on your front porch listening to the stories of friends and family. It is about sharing a glass of tea with your grandfather, poured from a carafe he always kept full. It is about creating your own stories, steeping your life with the flavor of your travels and experiences. Because of this focus, each Runningbyrd creation comes with a story, in the grand tradition of the storytelling South, so that no matter who you are with when drinking your tea, you have a companion.

						<h2>Spicy Thai</h2>
						<br/>
						<p>
							While visiting tea plantations in Thailand, I met an elderly man who spent his entire working life tasting teas, judging and critiquing their flavor. I created Spicy Thai for him, melding the flavors of my trip with an idea that he might taste something different after all these years, gifting him a new experience that still felt like an old friend.

						<h2>Chocolate Peppermint</h2>
						<p>
							Legend has it that John Henry, after bursting his heart defeating the steam powered hammer, asked for two cool drinks of water. I imagine Chocolate Peppermint as those two cool drinks; two flavors, blending to provide a refreshing calm. It is a tea to give pause, to separate your long hard day from the relaxing evening to come.

						<h2>Summer Rain</h2>
						<p>
							On hot nights, nothing compares to sitting on the front porch swing feeling a thunderstorm roll in, its wind ruffling your feathers, its fire making you cool. Weâ€™ve had a long summer, so open a bottle of this spiced tea to swing the breezes your way. If slowly savored, lightning will crash on your palate.

						<h2>Apple Pie</h2>
						
						<p>
							Independence Day in my Georgia home meant deciding whether to make the run to Carolina for fireworks. Everyone has a different tradition for the 4th, but across the south, sweet tea and apple pie come standard. Runningbyrd Tea combines those flavors for an Independence Day Special, Apple Pie Tea. Fireworks not included.

						<h2>Berry Season</h2>
						
						<p>
							Most of the country has a season in which local berries are abundant. In Seattle, blackberries are available all summer. At times in Georgia, mulberries rain down. Folks in the Twin Cities pick free raspberries. Runningbyrd Tea is bringing berry season to a bottle in DC, saving you the flights and sticky fingers.

						<h2>Apple Cider Tea</h2>
						
						<p>
							Apples mean fall is here, the weather grows cooler, and it might be time to move inside from the porch.
							We gather fresh apples in myriad ways. I used to wait for my little brothers to waltz back down Rural Route 2 pushing a stroller filled with Jonagold, but my godsons race through crunchy leaves to beat each other to the best Braeburn. If time or circumstance keeps you from picking your own apples this season, pluck a bottle of Apple Cider Tea from the shelf instead.
							Apple cider tea is a perfect mix of mulling spices, apple and tea. Let it keep you company in your orchard this autumn.
